<p>I tackled the free online course nand2tetris: building a computer from first principles. In this course you are loosely guided to build an entire computer simulator, from basic logic circuits, up to an assembler, virtual machine, compiler and lexer.
The course is actually taught to Harvard computer science students!
I implemented all of these in Elixir, as the recursive nature of compiling and lexing lends itself well to this language.
It was great to understand what happens behind the scenes when you hit compile on your code, and the constraints and design choices that influence all of the languages we use today.
