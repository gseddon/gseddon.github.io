<p>IBM Interactive Experience was contracted by City of Melbourne to develop an iOS companion application for Melbourne Spring Fashion week. Our small team of 4 was given 6 weeks to build an app to &lsquo;wow&rsquo; the client. In addition to the key objective of displaying a calendar of events with a simple process for buying tickets, we wanted to display a curated fashion news feed to the user, adjusted individually based on their interests. We also were to use location tracking with bluetooth beacons scattered around the city to offer highly targeted promotions from nearby retailers.</p>

<p>I took a key position in this project, wholly implementing the location tracking in the app, under guidance of an engineer from Localz, our partner who provided the beacon hardware. I also wrote much of the app interface to our various backend servers, and gained plenty of experience in writing code which was resilient to networking errors and user behaviour edge cases. Working closely with our project manager I also helped push the app through IBM&rsquo;s arduous code review and licence check process, in collaboration our legal team based in the United States.</p>

<p>This was the toughest and most intense project I&rsquo;ve ever worked on but the end result was a gorgeous, highly functional iOS application, and it was very satisfying sitting with the team on the Fashion Week runways, watching people in the audience use our app!</p>
